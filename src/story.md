You are an interstellar travelbeing, and you are tasked with conducting a census for Earth's cities.

You are required to visit every city in your database, but you also want to get back home in time to watch the intergalactic sports competition. You park your voyage ship a bit beyond the furthest satellite, climb into your exploration pod, and program a route through every city.

Your exploration pod can hover slightly above the tallest mountain, but any higher and the atmosphere is too thin for hovering. Additionally, the ship cannot exceed the sound barrier, especially since going that fast would attract attention from the primates down below. Most importantly, your pod has a limited power supply. It's best not too travel too much, lest you get stranded.

What order should you visit the cities to minimize your travel distance?
